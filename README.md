# Dictionfairy is out for Windows!

I study computer science and German. Sometimes, when I'm reading material for my German classes, I need to look up a word. Unfortunately, this means I need to open a whole new tab. No thanks!

## Just the basics, for now
- Hovers over your other tabs so you don't have to switch back and forth while you're reading
- Press ctrl+u to search the text you've selected, or ctrl+i to search the word you choose on your next click (you could also experiment with changing your hotkeys in the config.json file) 
- Right now, supports dwds.de, leo.org, and WordReference. 
- Basic accessibility and QoL adjustables
## Lots more to come! Future features:
- Custom hotkey configuration
- Support for user-added/generic dictionaries
- Support for other languages
- Themes
- Searches editable in-place
 ## ‚ö†Ô∏è ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: You might have issues with virus detection. It'd be great if you could let me know - it seems to be an issue with PyInstaller.

Cheers ü•Ç
